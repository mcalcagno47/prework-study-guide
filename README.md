Prework for the coding boot camp

# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a prework study guide for the coding boot camp starting on September 19, 2022 through Northwestern University, put on by Trilogy Education Services.

With this prework complete, and the boot camp weeks away, I am more excited than ever to begin what I hope to be a career-changing program. If for whatever reason, I cannot find a job coding, I look forward to sharing this knowledge with my students.

This project was built so I could become accustomed to gitflow, Visual Studio Code, and the portal I'll be using to receive and turn in work during the program.

This project allows me to refer back to an easily read site whenever I need to reference past works.

I learned a lot while doing this! I had never worked with gitbash before, and getting practice in that was good for me, according to my friends in the tech industry.

## Features

I can't emphasize this enough. This is a nigh-featureless website circa 1998.

Meet me at the flag pole at 3PM, and bring the money.
